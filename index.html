        <h2>Birth of Hazrat Musa (A.S.)</h2>
        <p class="story-paragraph">Hazrat Musa (A.S.) was born during a time when the Pharaoh of Egypt was oppressing the children of Israel. It was prophesied that a child from the children of Israel would rise and overthrow Pharaoh. To protect Musa, his mother placed him in a basket and set him afloat on the Nile River, where he was later found by Pharaoh's wife, Asiya.</p>

    <section id="childhood">
        <h2>Childhood of Hazrat Musa (A.S.)</h2>
        <p class="story-paragraph">Musa grew up in Pharaoh's palace, unaware of his true heritage. He was raised by Pharaoh's wife Asiya, who loved him dearly. When he grew older, Hazrat Musa (A.S.) became aware of the oppression of his people, the Israelites, and one day he killed an Egyptian man who was mistreating a Hebrew slave.</p>

    <section id="death">
        <h2>The Death of Hazrat Musa (A.S.)</h2>
