        <h2>Birth & Early Life</h2>
        <p>Prophet Musa was born during a time when the Pharaoh of Egypt had ordered all newborn Israelite boys to be killed. To save her son, Musa's mother placed him in a basket and set it adrift in the Nile River. Allah’s plan led the basket to the Pharaoh’s palace, where Musa was discovered and adopted by the Pharaoh’s wife, Asiya. She raised him as her own child, though Musa remained aware of his true heritage.</p>

    <section id="mission">
        <h2>The Divine Mission</h2>
        <p>While living in Midian, Prophet Musa received a divine call from Allah at the burning bush on Mount Sinai. Allah instructed him to return to Egypt and confront Pharaoh, demanding the release of the Israelites from slavery. With the support of his brother, Prophet Harun (Aaron), Musa delivered Allah's message. Despite witnessing miracles such as Musa’s staff turning into a serpent, Pharaoh and his advisors remained defiant.</p>

    <section id="red-sea">
        <h2>The Parting of the Red Sea</h2>
        <p>After years of oppression, Musa led the Israelites out of Egypt. Pharaoh and his army pursued them, but Allah commanded Musa to strike the Red Sea with his staff. The sea parted, creating a path for the Israelites to cross safely. Once they were through, the waters returned, drowning Pharaoh and his army, a powerful sign of Allah’s mercy and justice.</p>

    <section id="legacy">
        <h2>Legacy of Prophet Musa</h2>
        <p>Prophet Musa is remembered as one of the greatest prophets and leaders. He guided the Israelites with wisdom and faith and received the Torah, which serves as a foundation for divine laws in Islam, Christianity, and Judaism. His story reminds us of the importance of trust in Allah and perseverance in the face of hardship.</p>
